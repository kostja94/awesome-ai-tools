# Products Directory

This directory contains detailed information about individual products.

## Structure

Each product should have its own Markdown file named `[product-name].md` (lowercase, hyphens for spaces).

## File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Keep names concise and descriptive
- Examples:
  - `chatgpt.md`
  - `midjourney.md`
  - `notion-ai.md`

## Template

When creating a new product file, use the [TEMPLATE.md](../TEMPLATE.md) as a reference.

## Examples

- [Example Product 1](example-product-1.md)
- [Example Product 2](example-product-2.md)
